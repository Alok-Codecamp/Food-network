        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
          I always love to talk to people and cook something new and present it
          to people. For several years before the Food Network restaurant
          opened, I hosted the hugely popular Superplabs and Pop-Up. I was
          raised in an Indian palace before I moved to the UK and completed the
          British constitutional law Ph.D. I always try to increase the presence
          of women in the food industry.

          <h2>Vegetable Fried Rice</h2>
          <p>
            This dish combines the nutty flavor of brown rice with the fresh
            taste of bell peppers, baby peas, and other vegetables.

          <h2>HUMPTY-DUMPTY SANDWICHES</h2>
          <p>
            Instead of relying on ordinary egg salad, I like to spark up
            brown-bag lunches with this hearty sandwich. Every bite is filled
            with eggs, cheese and flavor.-Cheryl Miller, Fort Collins, Colorado

          <h2>Baked Chicken Pasta</h2>
          <p>
            Although pasta is not a traditional Lebanese ingredient, but this
            dish was a favorite in our house, not just in Ramadan, but any time
            of the year. It is filling, delicious, quick to make especially if
            you buy
