        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
          I always love to talk to people and cook something new and present it
          to people. For several years before the Food Network restaurant
          opened, I hosted the hugely popular Superplabs and Pop-Up. I was
          raised in an Indian palace before I moved to the UK and completed the
          British constitutional law Ph.D. I always try to increase the presence
          of women in the food industry.
